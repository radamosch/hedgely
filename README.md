Hegdely is an Ethereum smart contract investment game with 10 symbol options to choose from.

At the start of each session, the system seeds the options with random values to stir the market.

When the session ends, all investors with Ether on the LOWEST symbol receive 8 times their stake!

Each session lasts for a minimum of 100 blocks before it goes into overtime.
Any transaction on or after the 100th block will cause the session to end so long as there is only one lowest option.

The session will continue until there is only one lowest option. Winnings will then be distributed and the next session automatically started.
